TrustedPMDealers plugin for WordPress/WooCommerce is a tool for publishing gold coins and bars to the TrustedPMDealers.com drectory.

== Description ==

<a title="TrustedPMDealers.com" href="https://trustedpmdealers.com"><strong>TrustedPMDealers.com</strong></a> is a complex online project aimed at building win-win relations between precious metals investors, buyers, and dealers around the globe. For the benefit of our visitors we created a database of accurate information on each precious metal dealer, including descriptions of their stocks and services, contact details, customer reviews and ratings, equipped with a convenient product search mechanism.

Over the years of development for the precious metal industry we learned a lot about the needs and pains of investors, buyers, and dealers worldwide. On the one hand, there are buyers struggling to find the right products at reasonable prices offered by trustworthy dealers. On the other hand, there are dealers struggling to get more visibility and win trust. There are a lot of websites trying to tackle these problems to some extent. We decided to go a step further, and used our expansive IT expertise and experience of development for the precious metals market to create <a title="TrustedPMDealers.com" href="https://trustedpmdealers.com"><strong>TrustedPMDealers.com</strong></a>, a comprehensive solution for this industry.

As a part of the solution we decided to develop a tool for easy upload of information about coins and bars to <a title="TrustedPMDealers.com" href="https://trustedpmdealers.com"><strong>TrustedPMDealers.com</strong></a>. With TrustedPMDealers plugin for WordPress/WooCommerce this process becomes fast and easy. Each time there are some changes to your products on WordPress/WooCommerce site, like price or status change, the changes will be applied to correspondent records on TrustedPMDealers. To support high level of integration the plugin connects to TrustedPMDealers.com via API and verifies a dealer by an API Key. The Key is generated under the dealer's profile on TrustedPMDealers.com and is unique for every dealer.
